Parsers can automatically generate abstract syntax trees which can be further processed with tree parsers. ANTLR provides a single consistent notation for specifying lexers, parsers, and tree parsers. This is in contrast with other parser/lexer generators and adds greatly to the tool\u0027s ease of use. By default, ANTLR reads a grammar and generates a recognizer for the language defined by the grammar (i.e. a program that reads an input stream and generates an error if the input stream does not conform to the syntax specified by the grammar). If there are no syntax errors, then the default action is to simply exit without printing any message. In order to do something useful with the language, actions can be attached to grammar elements in the grammar. These actions are written in the programming language in which the recognizer is being generated. When the recognizer is being generated, the actions are embedded in the source code of the recognizer at the appropriate points. Actions can be used to build and check symbol tables and to emit instructions in a target language, in the case of a compiler. As well as lexers and parsers, ANTLR can be used to generate tree parsers. These are recognizers that process abstract syntax trees which can be automatically generated by parsers.

Such tests fail when the behaviour of the aspect under test deviates from the expected behaviour, yet continue to pass when minor, unrelated changes to the behaviour are made.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"documentsid":0,"version":"1.1","url":"/modules/tech-java-webservice/files/mod_hamcrest-core_1.1/1.1/mod_hamcrest-core_1.1-1.1.zip","modulesid":0}]},{"id":"mod_hibernate_3.2.5.ga","groupId":"org.hibernate","artifactId":"hibernate","name":"hibernate","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Hibernate is an open source project whose purpose is to make it easy to integrate relational data into Java programs.\n\n","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Hibernate is an object-relational mapping (ORM) library for the Java language, providing a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a traditional relational database.

It distinguishes between an application server such as an EJB server and an application component. It provides an interface, javax.transaction.TransactionManager, that is used by the application server itself to begin, commit and rollback the transactions. It provides a different interface, the javax.transaction.UserTransaction, that is used by general client code such as a servlet or an EJB to manage the transactions.\n\nJava Transaction API:\n\nThe Java Transaction API consists of three elements: a high-level application transaction demarcation interface, a high-level transaction manager interface intended for an application server, and a standard Java mapping of the X/Open XA protocol intended for a transactional resource manager. The javax.transaction.UserTransaction interface provides the application the ability to control transaction boundaries programmatically. This interface may be used by Java client programs or EJB beans. The UserTransaction.begin method starts a global transaction and associates the transaction with the calling thread. The transaction-to-thread association is managed transparently by the Transaction Manager.\nSupport for nested transactions is not required. The UserTransaction.begin method throws the NotSupportedException when the calling thread is already associated with a transaction and the transaction manager implementation does not support nested transactions. Transaction context propagation between application programs is provided by the underlying transaction manager implementations on the client and server machines. The transaction context format used for propagation is protocol dependent and must be negotiated between the client and server hosts. For example, if the transaction manager is an implementation of the JTS specification, it will use the transaction context propagation format as specified in the CORBA OTS 1.1 specification.

ANTLR provides a single consistent notation for specifying lexers, parsers, and tree parsers. This is in contrast with other parser/lexer generators and adds greatly to the tool\u0027s ease of use. By default, ANTLR reads a grammar and generates a recognizer for the language defined by the grammar (i.e. a program that reads an input stream and generates an error if the input stream does not conform to the syntax specified by the grammar). If there are no syntax errors, then the default action is to simply exit without printing any message. In order to do something useful with the language, actions can be attached to grammar elements in the grammar. These actions are written in the programming language in which the recognizer is being generated. When the recognizer is being generated, the actions are embedded in the source code of the recognizer at the appropriate points. Actions can be used to build and check symbol tables and to emit instructions in a target language, in the case of a compiler.

In order to do something useful with the language, actions can be attached to grammar elements in the grammar.

JTA is a specification developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 907. \n\nThe JTA API consists of classes in two Java packages:\n1)javax.transaction\n2)javax.transaction.xa\n\nThe JTA is modelled on the X/Open XA architecture, but it defines two different APIs for demarcating transaction boundaries. It distinguishes between an application server such as an EJB server and an application component. It provides an interface, javax.transaction.TransactionManager, that is used by the application server itself to begin, commit and rollback the transactions. It provides a different interface, the javax.transaction.UserTransaction, that is used by general client code such as a servlet or an EJB to manage the transactions.\n\nJava Transaction API:\n\nThe Java Transaction API consists of three elements: a high-level application transaction demarcation interface, a high-level transaction manager interface intended for an application server, and a standard Java mapping of the X/Open XA protocol intended for a transactional resource manager. The javax.transaction.UserTransaction interface provides the application the ability to control transaction boundaries programmatically. This interface may be used by Java client programs or EJB beans. The UserTransaction.begin method starts a global transaction and associates the transaction with the calling thread. The transaction-to-thread association is managed transparently by the Transaction Manager.\nSupport for nested transactions is not required. The UserTransaction.begin method throws the NotSupportedException when the calling thread is already associated with a transaction and the transaction manager implementation does not support nested transactions. Transaction context propagation between application programs is provided by the underlying transaction manager implementations on the client and server machines. The transaction context format used for propagation is protocol dependent and must be negotiated between the client and server hosts.

JTA is a specification developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 907. \n\nThe JTA API consists of classes in two Java packages:\n1)javax.transaction\n2)javax.transaction.xa\n\nThe JTA is modelled on the X/Open XA architecture, but it defines two different APIs for demarcating transaction boundaries. It distinguishes between an application server such as an EJB server and an application component. It provides an interface, javax.transaction.TransactionManager, that is used by the application server itself to begin, commit and rollback the transactions. It provides a different interface, the javax.transaction.UserTransaction, that is used by general client code such as a servlet or an EJB to manage the transactions.\n\nJava Transaction API:\n\nThe Java Transaction API consists of three elements: a high-level application transaction demarcation interface, a high-level transaction manager interface intended for an application server, and a standard Java mapping of the X/Open XA protocol intended for a transactional resource manager. The javax.transaction.UserTransaction interface provides the application the ability to control transaction boundaries programmatically. This interface may be used by Java client programs or EJB beans. The UserTransaction.begin method starts a global transaction and associates the transaction with the calling thread. The transaction-to-thread association is managed transparently by the Transaction Manager.\nSupport for nested transactions is not required. The UserTransaction.begin method throws the NotSupportedException when the calling thread is already associated with a transaction and the transaction manager implementation does not support nested transactions. Transaction context propagation between application programs is provided by the underlying transaction manager implementations on the client and server machines.

First, JAXB contains a compiler that reads a schema and produces the equivalent Java object model. This generated object model captures the structure of XML better than general-purpose APIs like DOM or SAX, making it a lot easier to manipulate XML content.\nThe second part is an API, through which applications communicate with generated code. This API hides provider-specific implementation code from applications and also provides a uniform way to do basic operations, such as marshalling or unmarshalling. The JAXB API, defined in the javax.xml.bind package, is a set of interfaces through which client applications communicate with code generated from a schema. The center of the JAXB API is JAXBContext, the client\u0027s entry point. It provides an abstraction for managing the XML-Java binding information necessary to implement the JAXB binding framework operations: unmarshal, marshal and validate.\n\nThese three aspects of JAXB are covered by three separate interfaces. Instances of those interfaces can be created from a JAXBContext object:\n1)Unmarshaller: governs the process of deserializing XML data into Java content trees, optionally validating the XML data as it is unmarshalled;\n2)Marshaller: governs the process of serializing Java content trees back into XML data;\n3)Validator: performs the validation on an in-memory object graph.\n\nJAXBContext is an abstract class defined in the API, so its actual implementation is vendor-dependent. To create a new instance of JAXBContext, you use the static newInstance method. This method takes a list of package names as a parameter. Each schema is compiled into a single package, which means that you can assemble them at run-time by providing multiple package names.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_stax-api_1.0-2","groupId":"javax.xml.stream","artifactId":"stax-api","name":"Stax-api","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Streaming API for XML (StAX) is an application programming interface (API) to read and write XML documents.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"StAX is a standard XML processing API that allows you to stream XML data from and to your application. Streaming API for XML (StAX) is an application programming interface (API) to read and write XML documents, originating from the Java programming language community.\n\nTraditionally, XML APIs are either:\n1)DOM based - the entire document is read into memory as a tree structure for random access by the calling application\n2)event based - the application registers to receive events as entities are encountered within the source document.\n\nBoth have advantages; the former (for example, DOM) allows for random access to the document, the latter (e.g. SAX) requires a small memory footprint and is typically much faster. These two access metaphors can be thought of as polar opposites. A tree based API allows unlimited, random access and manipulation, while an event based API is a \u0027one shot\u0027 pass through the source document. StAX was designed as a median between these two opposites. In the StAX metaphor, the programmatic entry point is a cursor that represents a point within the document. The application moves the cursor forward - \u0027pulling\u0027 the information from the parser as it needs.

JTA is a specification developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 907. \n\nThe JTA API consists of classes in two Java packages:\n1)javax.transaction\n2)javax.transaction.xa\n\nThe JTA is modelled on the X/Open XA architecture, but it defines two different APIs for demarcating transaction boundaries. It distinguishes between an application server such as an EJB server and an application component. It provides an interface, javax.transaction.TransactionManager, that is used by the application server itself to begin, commit and rollback the transactions. It provides a different interface, the javax.transaction.UserTransaction, that is used by general client code such as a servlet or an EJB to manage the transactions.\n\nJava Transaction API:\n\nThe Java Transaction API consists of three elements: a high-level application transaction demarcation interface, a high-level transaction manager interface intended for an application server, and a standard Java mapping of the X/Open XA protocol intended for a transactional resource manager. The javax.transaction.UserTransaction interface provides the application the ability to control transaction boundaries programmatically. This interface may be used by Java client programs or EJB beans. The UserTransaction.begin method starts a global transaction and associates the transaction with the calling thread. The transaction-to-thread association is managed transparently by the Transaction Manager.\nSupport for nested transactions is not required. The UserTransaction.begin method throws the NotSupportedException when the calling thread is already associated with a transaction and the transaction manager implementation does not support nested transactions. Transaction context propagation between application programs is provided by the underlying transaction manager implementations on the client and server machines. The transaction context format used for propagation is protocol dependent and must be negotiated between the client and server hosts. For example, if the transaction manager is an implementation of the JTS specification, it will use the transaction context propagation format as specified in the CORBA OTS 1.1 specification. Transaction propagation is transparent to application programs.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable. The main usage scenario when you might prefer to use the BeanFactory is when memory usage is the greatest concern (such as in an applet where every last kilobyte counts), and you don\u0027t need all the features of the ApplicationContext.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable. The main usage scenario when you might prefer to use the BeanFactory is when memory usage is the greatest concern (such as in an applet where every last kilobyte counts), and you don\u0027t need all the features of the ApplicationContext.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable. The main usage scenario when you might prefer to use the BeanFactory is when memory usage is the greatest concern (such as in an applet where every last kilobyte counts), and you don\u0027t need all the features of the ApplicationContext.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable. The main usage scenario when you might prefer to use the BeanFactory is when memory usage is the greatest concern (such as in an applet where every last kilobyte counts), and you don\u0027t need all the features of the ApplicationContext.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable. The main usage scenario when you might prefer to use the BeanFactory is when memory usage is the greatest concern (such as in an applet where every last kilobyte counts), and you don\u0027t need all the features of the ApplicationContext.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

The most commonly used simple BeanFactory implementation is org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.XmlBeanFactory. (This should be qualified with the reminder that ApplicationContexts are a subclass of BeanFactory, and most users end up using XML variants of ApplicationContext).For many usage scenarios, user code will not have to instantiate the BeanFactory or ApplicationContext, since Spring Framework code will do it. Bean definitions inside a DefaultListableBeanFactory variant (like XmlBeanFactory) are represented as BeanDefinition objects, which contain (among other information) the following details:a class name: this is normally the actual implementation class of the bean being described in the bean definition. However, if the bean is to be constructed by calling a static factory method instead of using a normal constructor, this will actually be the class name of the factory class. bean behavioral configuration elements, which state how the bean should behave in the container (i.e. prototype or singleton, autowiring mode, dependency checking mode, initialization and destruction methods)\n\nconstructor arguments and property values to set in the newly created bean. An example would be the number of connections to use in a bean that manages a connection pool (either specified as a property or as a constructor argument), or the pool size limit. other beans a bean needs to do its work, i.e. collaborators (also specified as properties or as constructor arguments). These can also be called dependencies.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable. The main usage scenario when you might prefer to use the BeanFactory is when memory usage is the greatest concern (such as in an applet where every last kilobyte counts), and you don\u0027t need all the features of the ApplicationContext.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable. The main usage scenario when you might prefer to use the BeanFactory is when memory usage is the greatest concern (such as in an applet where every last kilobyte counts), and you don\u0027t need all the features of the ApplicationContext.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable.

The most commonly used simple BeanFactory implementation is org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.XmlBeanFactory.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable. The main usage scenario when you might prefer to use the BeanFactory is when memory usage is the greatest concern (such as in an applet where every last kilobyte counts), and you don\u0027t need all the features of the ApplicationContext.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

While OO decomposes applications into a hierarchy of objects, AOP decomposes programs into aspects or concerns. This enables modularization of concerns such as transaction management that would otherwise cut across multiple objects. (Such concerns are often termed crosscutting concerns.) One of the key components of Spring is the AOP framework. While the Spring IoC containers (BeanFactory and ApplicationContext) do not depend on AOP, meaning you don\u0027t need to use AOP if you don\u0027t want to, AOP complements Spring IoC to provide a very capable middleware solution.\n\nAOP is used in Spring:\n1)To provide declarative enterprise services, especially as a replacement for EJB declarative services. The most important such service is declarative transaction management, which builds on Spring\u0027s transaction abstraction.\n2)To allow users to implement custom aspects, complementing their use of OOP with AOP.\n\nThus you can view Spring AOP as either an enabling technology that allows Spring to provide declarative transaction management without EJB; or use the full power of the Spring AOP framework to implement custom aspects. If you are interested only in generic declarative services or other pre-packaged declarative middleware services such as pooling, you don\u0027t need to work directly with Spring AOP, and can skip most of this chapter.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable. The main usage scenario when you might prefer to use the BeanFactory is when memory usage is the greatest concern (such as in an applet where every last kilobyte counts), and you don\u0027t need all the features of the ApplicationContext.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable. The main usage scenario when you might prefer to use the BeanFactory is when memory usage is the greatest concern (such as in an applet where every last kilobyte counts), and you don\u0027t need all the features of the ApplicationContext.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable. The main usage scenario when you might prefer to use the BeanFactory is when memory usage is the greatest concern (such as in an applet where every last kilobyte counts), and you don\u0027t need all the features of the ApplicationContext.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable. The main usage scenario when you might prefer to use the BeanFactory is when memory usage is the greatest concern (such as in an applet where every last kilobyte counts), and you don\u0027t need all the features of the ApplicationContext.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable. The main usage scenario when you might prefer to use the BeanFactory is when memory usage is the greatest concern (such as in an applet where every last kilobyte counts), and you don\u0027t need all the features of the ApplicationContext.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable. The main usage scenario when you might prefer to use the BeanFactory is when memory usage is the greatest concern (such as in an applet where every last kilobyte counts), and you don\u0027t need all the features of the ApplicationContext.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable. The main usage scenario when you might prefer to use the BeanFactory is when memory usage is the greatest concern (such as in an applet where every last kilobyte counts), and you don\u0027t need all the features of the ApplicationContext.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

These dependencies are reflected in the configuration data used by the BeanFactory (although some dependencies may not be visible as configuration data, but rather be a function of programmatic interactions between beans at runtime). A BeanFactory is represented by the interface org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory, for which there are multiple implementations. The most commonly used simple BeanFactory implementation is org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.XmlBeanFactory.

Bean definitions inside a DefaultListableBeanFactory variant (like XmlBeanFactory) are represented as BeanDefinition objects, which contain (among other information) the following details:a class name: this is normally the actual implementation class of the bean being described in the bean definition. However, if the bean is to be constructed by calling a static factory method instead of using a normal constructor, this will actually be the class name of the factory class. bean behavioral configuration elements, which state how the bean should behave in the container (i.e. prototype or singleton, autowiring mode, dependency checking mode, initialization and destruction methods)\n\nconstructor arguments and property values to set in the newly created bean.

Code in these packages provides the basis for Spring\u0027s Inversion of Control (alternately called Dependency Injection) features. The BeanFactory provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing beans (objects) of any nature, using potentially any kind of storage facility. The ApplicationContext builds on top of the BeanFactory (it\u0027s a subclass) and adds other functionality such as easier integration with Springs AOP features, message resource handling (for use in internationalization), event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create the ApplicationContext and optional parent contexts, and application-layer specific contexts such as the WebApplicationContext, among other enhancements.\nIn short, the BeanFactory provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, while the ApplicationContext adds enhanced capabilities to it, some of them perhaps more J2EE and enterprise-centric. In general, an ApplicationContext is a complete superset of a BeanFactory, and any description of BeanFactory capabilities and behavior should be considered to apply to ApplicationContexts as well.\nUsers are sometimes unsure whether a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext are best suited for use in a particular situation. Normally when building most applications in a J2EE-environment, the best option is to use the ApplicationContext, since it offers all the features of the BeanFactory and adds on to it in terms of features, while also allowing a more declarative approach to use of some functionality, which is generally desirable. The main usage scenario when you might prefer to use the BeanFactory is when memory usage is the greatest concern (such as in an applet where every last kilobyte counts), and you don\u0027t need all the features of the ApplicationContext.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_commons-logging_1.1.1","groupId":"commons-logging","artifactId":"commons-logging","name":"Commons-logging","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Commons logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementation portable with any logging implementation at runtime.\nCommons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable bridging to other, well known logging systems.

While a major use of XMLBeans is to access your XML instance data with strongly typed Java classes there are also API\u0027s that allow you access to the full XML infoset (XMLBeans keeps XML Infoset fidelity) as well as to allow you to reflect into the XML schema itself through an XML Schema Object model.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"dependentModules":[{"id":"mod_json-lib_0.9","groupId":"net.sf.json-lib","artifactId":"json-lib","name":"Json-lib","core":true,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Java library for transforming beans, maps, collections, java  arrays and XML to JSON.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"JSON-lib is a java library for transforming beans, maps, collections, java arrays and XML to JSON and back again to beans and DynaBeans.
